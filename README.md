# CV & AI LeetCode

This repository contains my structured preparation for **Computer Vision and AI Engineering interviews**.

Rather than solving generic LeetCode problems, this repo focuses on:
- Algorithms commonly used in ML & CV pipelines
- Math foundations required for deep learning
- Computer vision geometry and evaluation metrics
- Practical PyTorch implementations
- ML systems topics such as numerical stability and performance
